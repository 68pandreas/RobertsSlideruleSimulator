<h1>
Collection of Slide Rule replicas
</h1>
<!--
For centuries slide rule was used for all mathematical and engineering purposes<br />
until its natural beauty and elegance was overshadowed by perceived efficiency of a digital calculator and then computer.
<br /><br />-->
Slide rules are not manufactured any more.<br/>
The ones, which still exist, will eventually deteriorate with time.<br />
<br />
On this site you will find a collection of some of the most prominent models<br />
carefully hand-crafted and reproduced in JavaScript.<br />
And most importantly, they can be yours right now, totally free.<br />
All you need to do is to Save Page As... in your browser of choice<br />
and the slide rule replica is yours forever.<br />
<br />
<font size=-1>
(Technical information: all replicas can work without any active internet connection. They do not rely on any external digital communication and as such, are digitally safe.)
