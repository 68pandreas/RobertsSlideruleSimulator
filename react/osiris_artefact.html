<div class = lore>
Before you are allowed to access Hiram Abif's artefact your principles need to be put to the test.
As the artefact you are seeking is very powerful, these tests are, in fact, for your safety and protection!
</div>

<div class = lore>
The Temple Mount was located directly above the ruins of the Temple of Solomon, King of ancient Israel.
The knights began excavation works immediately and discovered a crypt which contained a number of ancient and mysterious artefacts.
One of those artefact was the tool of Hiram Abif's, the constructor of the Solomon Temple.
This very powerful artefact allowed him to perform very complex calculations necessary for the construction of the Temple.
Although its origins are not known, some say it was the legacy of an ancient and mysterious civilisation.
Some other say that it was the God Himself, who gave it to King Solomon.
</div>

<div class = lore>
When Hugues de Payens and his knights returned to France the Knight Templars order grew rapidly achieving great wealth, prominence and power.
Armed with the newly discovered ancient and mysterious lore, they began Gothic style and laid down the foundation of the modern banking system.
With Knight Templars being guardians of the peace, Europe enjoyed 200 years of peace and prosperity.
</div>

<br />

<div class = lore>
In 1305 the King Philip IV of France, together with Pope Clement V, both being heavily in debt, decided to appropriate Kinght Templar's wealth.
At dawn on Friday, 13th October 1307, under fabricated accusations, they arrested the entire order. Prosecution, torture and executions followed.
However, many members of the order escaped and managed to hide and preserve their secrets and mysteries leaving Philip IV and Clement V empty handed.
Both the king and the pope died horrible deaths soon after and the entire Europe sank into a long 100-years war and turmoil.
Nevertheless, every Friday the 13th is considered unlucky ever since.
</div>

<br />

<div class = lore>
The surviving Knight Templars and their successors secretly continued to influence the development of civilisation.
Many achievements of humankind can be attributed to the hidden knowledge practiced by the order.
After all, the cities of Washington in USA, Adelaide in South Australi and Christchurch in New Zealand
were build according to the principles which were found by Hugues de Payens under the ruins of Solomons Temple in 1119....
</div>

<br />

<div class = lore>
The ancient and mysterious artefact of Hiram Abif's is a powerful and dangerous tool.
It allowes you to design and build thing of great beauty.
However, it can be also used to inflict immense destruction.
Indeed, it was used not only to send man to the Moon but also to build nuclear bombs, which killed thousands in Hiroshima.
It is therefore necessary for you to put your principles to the test of merit,
before you can be granted access to this ancient and mysterious artefact of Hiram Abif.
